Analyzing the chat of twitch vods and assigning a score based on number of emotes or keywords


This was a weekend coding idea.
To save yourself the time of watching a VOD of a boring match use the analyzer to find out how people reacted.

Currently using some Overwatch keywords and twitch emotes to either increase or decrease the score.
Higher score means more interesting match. The generated txt files also show a distribiution of the keywords.
